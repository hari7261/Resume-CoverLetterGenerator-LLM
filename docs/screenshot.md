# Screenshot Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the application screenshot.

When you run the application, take a screenshot of the interface and save it as `screenshot.png` in this directory to replace this file.

The screenshot should show the main interface with:
- Input fields filled with sample data
- Model selection dropdown
- Generate button
- And if possible, the success state with download buttons
